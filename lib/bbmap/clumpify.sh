Description:  Sorts sequences to put similar reads near each other.
This is a wrapper for KmerSplit and KmerSort.
Works best with single-ended data.

Usage:   clumpify.sh in=<file> out=<file> groups=<number>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.

Optional parameters (and their defaults)

in=<file>           Input file.
out=<file>          Output file.  May not be standard out.
groups=16           Use this many intermediate files (to save memory).
rcomp=f             Give read clumps the same orientation.
                    Should be disabled for paired reads.
addname=f           Add kmer information to the name.
shortname=f         Make the name as short as possible.
                    May not be used with addname.
consensus=f         Generate consensus reads from clumps.
k=31                Use kmers of this length (1-31).
mincount=0          Ignore pivot kmers with count less than this.
prefilter=t         Use a prefilter if counting kmers.  Has no effect unless
                    mincount is at least 1.
ecco=f              For paired reads, error-correct via overlap.
overwrite=f         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather 
                    than overwrite an existing file.
ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change 
                    compression level; lower compression is faster.
delete=t            Delete temporary files.
usetmpdir=t         Use tmpdir for temp files.
compresstemp=auto   Gzip temporary files.  By default temp files will be
                    compressed if the output file is compressed.
tmpdir=             By default, this is the environment variable TMPDIR.
seed=1              Random seed for hashing.  Set to a negative number
                    to use a random seed.
hashes=4            Use this many masks when hashing.  0 uses raw kmers.


Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding
                    the program's automatic memory detection.  -Xmx20g will 
                    specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
